/* THANKS */				
	This project couldn't have been possible without learning from the difficulties of 
	others, documented on StackExchange. To all those who struggled with fabric.js before 
	me, I congratulate you. At times it was painful, but I had you to guide me through 
	the struggle. You have my thanks.
